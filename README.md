# Microservice starter in NodeJS & Typescript

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following installed:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community)
- NPM package manager. To install / update run the following command:
```
$ npm install npm@latest -g
```
- NPM packages: TypeScript and Serverless
```
$ npm i -g typescript serverless
```

### Running the project for the first time

Get a development environment up & running.

- Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/danielleklaasen/microservice-starter
```

- Install the node dependencies.

```
$ cd microservice-starter
$ npm i
```

- Configure Serverless with your own AWS account. You can find instruction on how to make an account [here]().

```
$ serverless config credentials --provider aws --key ACCESS-KEY-ID --secret SECRET-ACCESS-KEY
```

- Configure MongoDB

Add your personal url in app.ts, line 18.

- Build and run the project

```
$ tsc
```

```
$ sls offline start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 and, if everything went right, you will now see the working project! :)
